# Computer-Vision-Helmet-Detection

Deep learning models to classify whether employees are wearing safety helmets.

## Objective
SafeGuard Corp aims to improve employee safety by automatically detecting helmet usage.
The dataset contains ~631 images, and the goal is to build a model to predict whether a person is wearing a helmet or not.

## Techniques Used
- ANN
- CNN
- VGG-16 (transfer learning)
- Image preprocessing: grayscale, Gaussian blur
- Data augmentation

## Results
- ANN models showed clear overfitting
- CNN models performed better than ANN
- VGG-16 achieved the best performance, especially with augmented data
